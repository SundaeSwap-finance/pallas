## Indefinite length arrays

Each value in this section holds at least one array in its indefinite length
form. A whole generated value names its kind, its source and its index. A cut
value also names the item path inside that value, written as `[i]` for array
element `i` and `{k}` for map key `k`. A framed value places the cut item
inside the fixed CBOR shown, at `{}`, so that the ledger decodes it as a
transaction body or witness set. Every file below is a value the ledger's
decoder for its kind accepted. The expected values in
`pallas-primitives/src/dijkstra/tests.rs` are what the ledger read from these
bytes.

| file | from | item | frame | kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ppu-rational-indefinite.hex | ppu, cddl, 10 | whole | none | protocol parameter update |
| relay-indefinite.hex | tx, cddl, 39 | `[0] {4} [0] [8] [4]` | none | relay, cut from a pool registration |
| body-certificate-indefinite.hex | body, cddl, 63 | `{4} [6]` | `a40080018002000481{}` | transaction body |
| body-value-indefinite.hex | body, cddl, 61 | `{1} [3]` | `a300800181{}0200` | transaction body |
| tx-indefinite.hex | tx, cddl-plain, 0 | whole, outer array made indefinite | none | transaction |
| wits-constr-102-indefinite.hex | written by hand | none | `a10482d8669f1903e880ff01` | witness set |
| proposal-hard-fork-indefinite-version.hex | block, cddl, 78 | `[1] [0] [0] [0] {20} [1]` | `a40080018002001481{}` | transaction body |

The witness set was written by hand. It holds one constructor 102 datum,
`d8669f1903e880ff`, whose index and fields are in an indefinite array.

## Absent values written as null

A cut value names its kind, its source, its index and the item path inside
that value, written as `[i]` for array element `i`, `{k}` for map key `k` and
`tag258` for the set tag. A framed value places the cut items inside the
fixed CBOR shown, at each `{}` in order, so that the ledger decodes it as a
transaction body. Every file below is a value the ledger's decoder for its
kind accepted. The expected values in `pallas-primitives/src/conway/model.rs`
are what the ledger read from these bytes.

| file | from | items | frame | kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| body-certificates-ending-in-null.hex | body, cddl-plain | 95 `{4} tag258 [0]`, 21 `{4} [2]`, 11 `{4} [1]`, 16 `{4} [1]` | `a400d90102800180020004d9010284{}{}{}{}` | transaction body |
| body-governance-ending-in-null.hex | body, cddl-plain | 12 `{19}`, 71 `{20} tag258 [2]`, 22 `{20} tag258 [4]`, 22 `{20} tag258 [0]`, 25 `{20} tag258 [0]` | `a500d90102800180020013{}14d9010284{}{}{}{}` | transaction body |

Each item ends in an absent value that the CDDL types as `T / nil`: a pool
registration without metadata, a committee resignation, a DRep registration
and a DRep update without an anchor, a vote without an anchor, a constitution
without a guardrail script, and a parameter change, a treasury withdrawal and
a no confidence action without a previous action or policy.
